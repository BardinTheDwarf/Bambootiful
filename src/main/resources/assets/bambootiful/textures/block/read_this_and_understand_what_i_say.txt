multicraft, yet again...
okay, there is no point for having dolphin fins - but the pelts stays, as they were originally created back in the days of the 1.12.2 version, where you were able to craft a hoodie that you can wear, and the polar bears were thinking that you are one of them. *cuz there was only polar bear pelt back then*
last week i got to the point where i felt like im useless, and my existance is needless. not only my mod, my-entire-self. that was because you guys instead of trying to say something useful, just blamed my stuff very offensively. to be exact you shitted on everything that is on the page. kinda like my parents, they nevers see the good things i do only the bad ones. whatews, i got it through.
for those who was raging on this animal abuse shitty thing: *its a game faggots*. still, **WHY** should everything respect reality. why cant animals "be different" in a game. they dont exctinct, its infinit of them. mojang would never add this kind of features, because they listen to animal society, and dont want the little kids to think killing is good - me neither - but a person who can install a mod is (i wish) old enough to understand killing is bad and no need for a game to teach this.
**ilja615#2368** was the only person were the only normal ones, who didint started to attack. firstly, *-thanks-*. secondly, you understood my point, and not only attacked me, tryed to give some actually useful advice.
also i got the idea for a nature-reputation system, where things happen to you based on your nature-rep level. you hit animals, chop trees, "hurt the nature" will decrese your rep. planting trees, breeding animals - or only feeding them -, simply just helping nature will boost up your rep level.
if you rep is low, bad things happen - lightning strieks you, trees fall on you, animals attack you. if you rep is high, animals should give you bonus stuff (for example sheeps: more wool upon shearing, doplhins: drives you to rarer structure when fed with fish).

for an ending: i needed a week to calm down after that talk last week, thats why im copy pasting this message from a doc im writing, into discord to send. i cant type that fast in real-talking to answer 8 message at once. maybe i forgot to talk about something, maybe not. im 100% sure made some typos as well as grammar mistakes. but thats me. a guy from an unknown country, with an unknown language who is still trying to figure out enlgish on its own.
2471 characters, huh. well, dc will not send this as a message, instead it will as a text doc. OOf dc. thanks.
**i dont want to get to that state where i was last week, so please:**
-bagel and Radish had some well, "normal stuff" on the beginning: so im still open for a - normal - opinions (bagel, idc about if a thing is alredy done, i will make it. because: if athing is done, its not done how **I** wants it to be done. things will be changed. i wont copy exact things form mods, and the hats, well... idc. i didint knew about that were existed when i made them. i cant proove this, seem really like i lie, but, those are mine.)
-Cellulose is a good guy, as i said for ilja before, keep going with the good opinions
-"Meme Dealer (aka MD)#6906" **STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM ME** as i remember, you were a kinda toxic one in that talk, so: **S.T.H.A.F.M.**
-"PCAwesomeness#8027" had some word too, and as i read back the stuff, you see the point of it all - maybe i got too far with tha fin?
-i still reading back the stuff.... Radis you joined meme dealer in the pooping at the end... i still see you as normal person, please proof this next time.

----- some comments -----

i removed tridents from drowned, because i has a whole different plan for them. tridents arent become easyer to get. you still has to go through an ocean, find a monument and loot it. drowneds will have a full upgrade, new customes, more types. believe me. 
*"PCAwesomenessLast Saturday at 6:41 PM Anyways, where's the harmless Drowned idea?"* OOOH they wont be harmless - you will pray for your life.

i was kinda angry last week, but i wrote thisn calm mood - i want to keep this mood, so please guys, dont upset me, nor yourselves on this topic.

*"for (int 1 : yes) {ilja 615;Last Saturday at 6:03 PM i like those rotten foodies also,, but i think should have a more unique use than just compost item...."*
yes. gimme ideas.
aslo want to change how blueberries look. they will have different effects on foxes as well.

*"for (int 1 : yes) {ilja 615;Last Saturday at 6:01 PM the CHESE. guys this mod is just epic"*
you said this ironicly? i cant decide it :(

*"bagelLast Saturday at 6:00 PM Llama Fur, Fox Pelts,........And is not vanilla style"*
i should change the description of the mod: "vanilla style, and those stuff that i would like to see in-game."
also, bagel, animal abuse? having all those monster parts in the game, arent "monster abuse" ? like the spider eye, rotten fels, phantom membrane... i decided that this line is a joke.

okay, this message instead of sending throu copy paste method, will be saved as a txt doc, and send it via that, to avoid discord breaking some lines. i saw its doing it, it just breaks long lines. fock. 5226 characters. nice.
because there couldnt be a "," in the name of the file, i wrote a "_". just live with it.


for the last words:
*"RadishLast Saturday at 6:01 PM
Dolphin fin is way more offensive then the other things"*

no more dolphin fins. are ya happy now? mabye when i can make some improvements on dolphins, i bring it back, but this is not in the near future. not even in the far future. maybe in time of 1.86.43.4 version of the game. (the second half of this line is a "i decided that its a joke" too stuff.)

there are other ideas for the pelts, furs and leathers. they are staying.

the last line:
i was listening to this while i wrote this doc, you guys should listen it once... not sponsoring, but schmoyoho makes very good remixes/covers/songs.... i like them a lot. ALL OF THEM. CHICKEN ATTAAAAAAACK!!!!!
